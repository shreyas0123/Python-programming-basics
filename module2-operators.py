# 1.A. Write an equation which relates   399, 543 and 12345 
# B. “When I divide 5 with 3, I got 1. But when I divide -5 with 3, I got -2”—How would you justify it.

#1.A.
x,y,z = 399,543,12345 
z == 22*y + x #mathematical equation

#1.B.
5//3 # in order to get answers in integer we have to use integer division method
-5//3

# 2.a=5,b=3,c=10.. What will be the output of the following:
# A. a/=b
# B. c*=5  

a = 5
b = 3
c = 10

#2.A.
a = a/b # output of a/b=

#2.B.
c = c*5 # output of c*=5
